TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE Paid Products Some of the Products provided on this Website, as part of the Service, are provided on the basis of payment. The fees, duration and conditions applicable to the purchase of such Products are described below and in the dedicated sections of this
        Website. Product description Prices, descriptions or availability of Products are outlined in the respective sections of this Website and are subject to change without notice. While Products on this Website are presented with the greatest accuracy technically possible, representation on this Website through any means (including, as the case may be, graphic material, images, colors, sounds)
        is for reference only and implies no warranty as to the characteristics of the purchased Product. The characteristics of the chosen Product will be outlined during the purchasing process. Purchasing process Any steps taken from choosing a Product to order submission form part of the purchasing process. The purchasing process includes these steps: Users must choose the desired Product and
        verify their purchase selection. After having reviewed the information displayed in the purchase selection, Users may place the order by submitting it. Order submission When the User submits an order, the following applies: The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and therefore creates for the User the obligation to pay the price, taxes and possible further fees and
        expenses, as specified on the order page. In case the purchased Product requires an action from the User, such as the provision of personal information or data, specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation for the User to cooperate accordingly. Upon submission of the order, Users will receive a receipt confirming that the order has been received. All
        notifications related to the described purchasing process shall be sent to the email address provided by the User for such purposes. Prices Users are informed during the purchasing process and before order submission, about any fees, taxes and costs (including, if any, delivery costs) that they will be charged. Prices on this Website are displayed: either exclusive or inclusive of any
        applicable fees, taxes and costs, depending on the section the User is browsing. Methods of payment Information related to accepted payment methods is made available during the purchasing process. Some payment methods may only be available subject to additional conditions or fees. In such cases related information can be found in the dedicated section of this Website. All payments are
        independently processed through third-party services. Therefore, this Website does not collect any payment information – such as credit card details – but only receives a notification once the payment has been successfully completed. If a payment through the available methods fails or is refused by the payment service provider, the Owner shall be under no obligation to fulfill the purchase
        order. If a payment fails or is refused, the Owner reserves the right to claim any related expenses or damages from the User. Payment of price in installments The payment of the purchase price may be settled in two or more installments, within the deadlines specified on this Website or otherwise communicated by the Owner. Specific Products may be excluded from this payment model. If the
        User fails to meet any of the payment deadlines, the entire outstanding amount shall become immediately due and payable. Authorization for future PayPal payment If Users authorize the PayPal feature which allows future purchases, this Website will store an identification code linked to the Users’ PayPal account. This will authorize this Website to automatically process payments for future
        purchases or recurring installments of past purchases. This authorization can be revoked at any time, either by contacting the Owner or by changing the user settings offered by PayPal. Retention of Product ownership Until payment of the total purchase price is received by the Owner, any Products ordered shall not become the User’s property. Delivery Deliveries are made to the address
        indicated by the User and in the manner specified in the order summary. Upon delivery, Users should verify the content of the delivery and report anomalies without undue delay, using the contact details provided in this document or as described in the delivery note. Users may refuse to accept the parcel if visibly damaged. Goods are delivered to the countries or territories specified in
        the relevant section of this Website. Delivery times are specified on this Website or during the purchasing process. Failed delivery The Owner cannot be held responsible for delivery errors due to inaccuracies or incompleteness in the execution of the purchase order by the User, nor for any damages or delays after handover to any carrier arranged by the User and not offered or recommended
        by the Owner. If the goods are not received or collected at the time or within the deadline specified, the goods will be returned to the Owner, who will contact the User to schedule a second delivery attempt or to agree on the future course of action. Unless otherwise agreed, any delivery attempt starting from the second shall be at the User’s expense. User rights Right of withdrawal

Users that do not fit this qualification, cannot benefit from the rights described in this section. Exercising the right of withdrawal To exercise their right of withdrawal, Users must

Effects of withdrawal Users who
        correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed by the Owner for all payments made to the Owner, including, if any, those covering the costs of delivery.

        undue delay and, in any event, no later than 14 days from the day on which the Owner is informed of the User’s decision to withdraw from the contract. Unless otherwise agreed with the User, reimbursements will be made using the same means of payment as used to process the initial transaction.

        the carrier, or otherwise returned as indicated above, before the expiration of the 14-days-period for returning the goods.

        minimum period of 2 years from delivery, traders guarantee the conformity of the goods they sell to Consumers. Where Users qualify as European Consumers, the legal guarantee of conformity for goods applies to the items available on this Website in accordance with the laws of the country of their habitual residence. National laws of such country may grant Users broader rights. In
        particular, Consumers based in France can exercise guarantee rights within two years of delivery of the good without being required to provide evidence of the good’s defect or lack of conformity. The period of time for which the Consumer is exempted from providing evidence of the fault is reduced to six months in case of used goods. When exercising guarantee rights, Consumers may choose
        between requesting replacement or reparation of the faulty good at the conditions set out in the French Consumer Code. This statutory guarantee of conformity applies regardless of any commercial guarantee possibly offered by the Owner. Consumers may also exercise their right of guarantee for hidden faults according to the relevant provisions of the French Civil Code, choosing between
        cancelling the purchase or requesting a price reduction. Consumers who do not qualify as European may benefit from legal guarantee of conformity rights in accordance with the legislation of the country of their habitual residence. Conformity to contract for Consumers in the United Kingdom Users in the United Kingdom qualifying as Consumers have a right to receive goods that are in
        conformity with the contract. Legal guarantee of conformity for goods for Consumers in Brazil The legal guarantee applicable to goods sold by this Website (both physical and digital) complies with the following terms, according to the Consumer Protection Code: non-durable goods shall have a thirty-day (30 day) guarantee; and durable goods shall have a ninety-day (90 day) guarantee. The
        warranty period starts from the date of goods delivery. The warranty is not applicable in cases of misuse, natural events or if it has been subjected to any maintenance other than that provided by this Website. The warranty may be claimed through the contact channels provided by this Website. The Owner shall bear the costs of shipping the goods for technical assessment, if necessary. The
        Owner, at its own discretion, may also offer a contractual warranty in addition to the legal warranty. The regulations applicable to contractual warranties can be found in the specifications provided by this Website. If no such information is provided, only the statutory provisions shall apply. Liability and indemnification Unless otherwise explicitly stated or agreed with Users, the
        Owner’s liability for damages in connection with the execution of the Agreement shall be excluded, limited and/or reduced to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. Australian Users Limitation of liability Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts or modifies any guarantee, condition, warranty, right or remedy which the User may have under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010
        (Cth) or any similar State and Territory legislation and which cannot be excluded, restricted or modified (non-excludable right). To the fullest extent permitted by law, our liability to the User, including liability for a breach of a non-excludable right and liability which is not otherwise excluded under these Terms of Use, is limited, at the Owner’s sole discretion, to the
        re-performance of the services or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again. US Users Disclaimer of Warranties This Website is provided strictly on an “as is” and “as available” basis. Use of the Service is at Users’ own risk.

        express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including, but not limited to, any implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of third-party rights. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by the User from the Owner or through the Service will create any warranty not expressly stated herein. Without limiting the foregoing, the
        Owner, its subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers and employees do not warrant that the content is accurate, reliable or correct; that the Service will meet Users’ requirements; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location, uninterrupted or secure; that any defects or errors will be corrected; or that the
        Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. Any content downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the Service is downloaded at Users' own risk and Users shall be solely responsible for any damage to Users’ computer system or mobile device or loss of data that results from such download or Users’ use of the Service. The Owner does not warrant, endorse, guarantee, or
        assume responsibility for any product or service advertised or offered by a third party through the Service or any hyperlinked website or service, and the Owner shall not be a party to or in any way monitor any transaction between Users and third-party providers of products or services. The Service may become inaccessible or it may not function properly with Users’ web browser, mobile
        device, and/or operating system. The owner cannot be held liable for any perceived or actual damages arising from Service content, operation, or use of this Service. Federal law, some states, and other jurisdictions, do not allow the exclusion and limitations of certain implied warranties. The above exclusions may not apply to Users. This Agreement gives Users specific legal rights, and
        Users may also have other rights which vary from state to state. The disclaimers and exclusions under this agreement shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law. Limitations of liability To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Owner, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers and employees
        be liable for: any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to the use of, or inability to use, the Service; and any damage, loss or injury resulting from hacking, tampering or other unauthorized access or use of the
        Service or User account or the information contained therein; any errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content; personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from User access to or use of the Service; any unauthorized access to or use of the Owner’s secure servers and/or any and all personal information stored therein; any interruption or cessation of transmission

        In no event shall the Owner, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers and employees be liable for any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses or costs in an amount exceeding the amount paid by User to the Owner hereunder in the preceding 12 months, or the period of duration of this agreement between the Owner and
        User, whichever is shorter. This limitation of liability section shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if the User has been advised of the possibility of such damage. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
        incidental or consequential damages, therefore the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to the User. The terms give User specific legal rights, and User may also have other rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under the terms shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law. Indemnification The

        suppliers and employees to the extent allowed by applicable law.

        any provision of these Terms be deemed or become invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions, which shall remain in full force and effect. EU Users Should any provision of these Terms be or be deemed void, invalid or unenforceable, the parties shall do their best to find, in an

Without prejudice to the above, the nullity, invalidity or impossibility to
        enforce a particular provision of these Terms shall not nullify the entire Agreement, unless the severed provisions are essential to the Agreement, or of such importance that the parties would not have entered into the contract if they had known that the provision would not be valid, or in cases where the remaining provisions would translate into an unacceptable hardship on any of the
        parties. US Users Any such invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted, construed and reformed to the extent reasonably required to render it valid, enforceable and consistent with its original intent.

          To exercise their right of regret, Users must send to the Owner an unequivocal statement of their intention to withdraw from the contract. To this end, Users may use the model withdrawal form available from within the “definitions” section of this document. Users are, however, free to express their intention to withdraw from the contract by making an unequivocal statement in any other
          suitable way. In order to meet the deadline within which they can exercise such right, Users must send the regret notice before the regret period expires. When does the regret period expire?
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Regarding the purchase of goods,</strong> the regret period expires seven (7) days after the day on which the User or a third party designated by the User – other than the carrier – receives the goods.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Regarding the purchase of several goods ordered together</strong> but delivered separately, or in case of the purchase of a single good consisting of multiple lots or pieces delivered separately, the regret period expires seven (7) days after the day on which the User or a third party designated by the User – other than the carrier receives the last good, lot or piece.

        <h5 id="effects-of-regret">Effects of regret</h5>
        <p>Users who correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed by the Owner for all payments made to the Owner, including, if any, those covering the costs of delivery.</p>

        <p>However, any additional costs resulting from the choice of a particular delivery method other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by the Owner, will not be reimbursed.</p>

        <p>
          Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any event, no later than 14 days from the day on which the Owner is informed of the User’s decision to withdraw from the contract or the actual return of the product, whichever occurs later. Unless otherwise agreed with the User, reimbursements will be made using the same means of payment as used to process the initial
          transaction. In any event, the User shall not incur any costs or fees as a result of such reimbursement.

        <h6 id="on-the-purchase-of-physical-goods">…on the purchase of physical goods </h6>
        <p>Unless the Owner has offered to collect the goods, Users shall send back the goods or hand them over to the Owner, or to a person authorized by the latter to receive the goods, without undue delay and in any event within 14 days from the day on which they communicated their decision to withdraw from the contract.</p>

        <p>The deadline is met if the goods are handed to the carrier, or otherwise returned as indicated above, before the expiration of the 14-day period for returning the goods. The reimbursement may be withheld until receipt of the goods, or until Users have supplied evidence of having returned the goods, whichever is the earliest.</p>

        <p>Users shall only be liable for any diminished value of the goods resulting from the handling of the goods outside of that which is necessary to establish their nature, characteristics and functioning.</p>

        <p>The costs of returning the goods are borne by the Owner.</p>

        <h3 id="legal-guarantee-of-conformity-for-goods-under-eu-law">Legal guarantee of conformity for goods under EU law</h3>
        <p>Under EU law, for a minimum period of 2 years from delivery, traders guarantee the conformity of the goods they sell to Consumers.</p>

        <p>Where Users qualify as European Consumers, the legal guarantee of conformity for goods applies to the items available on this Website in accordance with the laws of the country of their habitual residence.</p>

        <p>National laws of such country may grant Users broader rights.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>In particular, Consumers based in France can exercise guarantee rights within two years of delivery of the good without being required to provide evidence of the good’s defect or lack of conformity. The period of time for which the Consumer is exempted from providing evidence of the fault is reduced to six months in case of used goods.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>When exercising guarantee rights, Consumers may choose between requesting replacement or reparation of the faulty good at the conditions set out in the French Consumer Code.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>This statutory guarantee of conformity applies regardless of any commercial guarantee possibly offered by the Owner.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Consumers may also exercise their right of guarantee for hidden faults according to the relevant provisions of the French Civil Code, choosing between cancelling the purchase or requesting a price reduction.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Consumers who do not qualify as European may benefit from legal guarantee of conformity rights in accordance with the legislation of the country of their habitual residence.</p>

        <p>The warranty period starts from the date of goods delivery.</p>
